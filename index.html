      <h3>Reading Passage 1</h3>
      <h4>The thylacine</h4>

      <h3>The thylacine</h3>

<p>
The extinct thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a marsupial* that bore a superficial resemblance to a dog. Its most distinguishing feature was the 13–19 dark brown stripes along its back and tail. Adult males averaged 162.6 cm in length from nose to tail, while females measured about 153.7 cm. The thylacine occupied most types of terrain except dense rainforest, with open eucalyptus forest believed to be its prime habitat.
</p>

<p>
The thylacine was exclusively carnivorous and possessed a muscular stomach capable of stretching to hold large quantities of food, an adaptation that likely helped it survive periods of unsuccessful hunting. Although not a fast runner, it probably caught prey by exhausting it during long pursuits, relying more on scent than other senses. It typically hunted in the evening, at night and in the early morning, retreating to hills or forests during the day.
</p>

<p>
Despite its nickname ‘tiger’, the thylacine had a shy and nervous temperament. Although mainly nocturnal, it was sometimes seen during daylight hours and was occasionally observed basking in the sun. The species had an extended breeding season from winter to spring, with some breeding occurring throughout the year. Like all marsupials, newborn thylacines were tiny and hairless and crawled into their mother’s pouch, where they remained attached to a teat for up to three months.
</p>

<p>
Once old enough to leave the pouch, the young stayed in well-hidden lairs such as rocky caves or hollow logs while the mother hunted. Around 4,000 years ago, the thylacine was widespread across New Guinea, mainland Australia and Tasmania. The most recent confirmed evidence on the mainland is a fossil dated to approximately 3,100 years ago. Its disappearance from mainland Australia coincided with the arrival of wild dogs known as dingoes.
</p>

<p>
Dingoes never reached Tasmania, which is believed to be the main reason the thylacine survived there longer. However, from the 1830s onwards, the population in Tasmania declined sharply, largely due to sheep farmers and bounty hunters**. Other contributing factors included competition with introduced wild dogs, loss of habitat, reduced prey availability and disease. Only one successful captive breeding occurred, at Melbourne Zoo in 1899.
</p>

<p>
Although naturalist John Gould predicted the species’ extinction in the 19th century, there was little public or scientific concern for its survival at the time. Limited protection was introduced too late, and the last known wild thylacine was killed in 1930. The final captive individual died in Hobart Zoo on 7 September 1936, and the species was officially declared extinct in 1986.
